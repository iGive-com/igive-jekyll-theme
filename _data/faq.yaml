- question: How does iGive work?
  answer: >-
    It’s easy! You start by shopping at iGive and a portion of your purchase is set aside and donated to your favorite cause, all at no cost to you or the cause or to you. We work with all types of causes — big or small, local or national, and regardless of whether they are a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit or not. 

- question: Where does the money come from for the donation?
  answer: >-
    Stores pay iGive a percentage of your purchase because they want customers like you to shop at their store.<br><br>
    This is different than when a cashier asks if you want to round up or add a dollar to donate when you checkout — in that case, you are paying slightly more to donate to the cause. With iGive, you pay the same amount you would if you didn’t use iGive, and your cause still receives the donation.

- question: Which stores participate with iGive?
  answer: >-

- question: Are my donations tax deductible in the U.S.?
  answer: >-
    Our lawyers require us to say this upfront - we are not tax experts and cannot give you specific tax advice. Please contact a tax advisor to determine what applies for your particular situation.<br><br>
    Next, iGive has a wide variety of causes available to choose from — some of which are 501(c)3 designated nonprofits who have gone through the IRS formalities to receive the status and therefore generally permit tax-deductible donations. Others, though, are less formal (and just as important!) causes, and the IRS generally does not permit you to take a tax deduction for giving them money. If you choose a cause that isn’t 501(c)3 designated, you're still supporting the cause with a donation, but you won’t be able to deduct it when you go to file your taxes.<br><br>
    If your tax advisor asks, here is how iGive functionally works -<br>
    The donation amount is a rebate on the price you paid for the purchase, by the retailer, and reduces the price, as a nontaxable event. You then direct iGive to give that rebated amount to the cause of your choosing, on your behalf. If, based on your personal tax circumstances and the cause’s appropriate status with the IRS, a cash donation to your selected cause would be deductible, then the amount you donated via iGive would generally also be deductible.<br><br>
    iGive is not able to provide specific tax or legal advice, and the information provided is not considered direct tax advice, because your tax situation is inherently unique.
